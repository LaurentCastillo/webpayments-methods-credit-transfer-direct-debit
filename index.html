	The Basic CT-DD Payment specification describes the data formats used by the PaymentRequest API [[!PAYMENTREQUESTAPI]] to support payment by Credit Transfer and Direct Debit including to the specific SEPA specification (SEPA Credit Transfer (SCT), SEPA Direct Debit (SDD CORE) and SEPA direct Debit between corporates (SDD B2B))

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
	This specification is a Payment Transaction Message Specification used by the PaymentRequest API [[!PAYMENTREQUESTAPI]] to support Credit Transfer and Direct Debits. It is intended to provide compatibility for merchants who currently request account details from customers to ease adoption of the PaymentRequest API.</p>
      <p>In the future, merchants may favor payment methods that provide a tokenized response rather than clear text details.</p>
